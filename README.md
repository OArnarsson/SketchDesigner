# SketchDesigner

### Setup/Usage
- Run <code>npm install</code> in the root of the project.  
- To run the application as is, navigate to <code>SketchDesigner/FrontEnd</code> and run the <code>ng build</code> command.
- When the CLI has finished building the <code>dist</code> folder, go to the <code>SketchDesigner/BackEnd</code> folder.  
- From there you can run <code>node app.js</code> to start the express server.
- You should now see <code>API running on localhost:3000</code>
- Now simply go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and go nuts!
